                            <p>As college students yourselves, you have a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities that arise in student life. With this prompt, we're asking you to draw from your own experiences to create something innovative and exciting. Whether you're interested in solving a problem, filling a digital void, or creating something purely entertaining, there are countless ways to approach this challenge.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Think about the problems you've encountered as students: Are there issues with the registration process or course selection? Do you struggle to manage your time effectively or balance your coursework with other obligations? Are there gaps in the resources and support available to students on your campus? Consider how you could use technology to address these issues in a new and innovative way.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>But don't limit yourself to problem-solving! Maybe you've noticed a “digital void” in the world of student life - something missing that you think could be filled by a creative digital solution. Or maybe you have an idea for a fun and engaging project that doesn't necessarily solve a problem but is entertaining and exciting in its own right.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to see what you all come up with. Remember, the key is to draw from your own experiences and think creatively about how technology can be used to enhance the student experience. So get started, and let your imaginations run wild!</p>
