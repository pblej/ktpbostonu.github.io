        <h1><span style="color: #a3e4a3;">"</span> history of kappa theta pi lambda chapter</h1>

        <p>Kappa Theta Pi takes pride in being the first professional technology fraternity in the country. Our members learn a plethora of skills needed to stay knowledgeable about the tech industry, as well as a strong sense of professional development for future job positions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>KTP was founded on January 10, 2012, at the University of Michigan. It was started with the mission to create a tech community that enthusiastic students could join. In making KTP, the founders set up a strong community that has only grown in the 11 years since its inception.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our members come from all around campus. We are designers, analysts, computer scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, economists, philosophers, psychologists, and more. What makes the KTP community strong is our shared passion for technology and our unique backgrounds meshing together as one.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our alumni are part of an extensive and tight-knit network that stretches across the country. They can be found from Seattle to New York, from Silicon Valley to Detroit, in both startup companies and larger businesses. Our alumni provide valuable insight for our members' professional development.</p>

                <h1>Inception of KTP Fraternity at University of Michigan (2011)</h1>
                <p>In December 2011, at the University of Michigan, two students (Louise Vongphrachanh and Jing Guo) founded a professional fraternity aimed at informatics students. After determining interest Louise and Jing hosted interviews and gathered KTP's first-ever E-Board of University of Michigan informatics students, their names are: Nisha Dwivedi, Jacqueline Fontaine, Brian Marshfield, Denny Tsai, and Julia Varghese.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
                <h1>Expansion and Sponsorship (2014)</h1>
                <p>Approaching 2014 the fraternity broadened its focus to encompass many technology-related majors including engineering and computer science. Soon later the University of Michigan School of Information officially sponsored the fraternity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
                <h1>Expansion Beyond Michigan (2015-2017)</h1>
                <p>From 2015-2017 the Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon chapters were established at the University of Pittsburgh, the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, and the University of Maryland respectively. All of these chapters continue to be active to this day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
                <h1>Nationwide Growth (Late-2019 to Mid-2022)</h1>
                <p>From late-2019 to mid-2022 we see the next few chapters pop up all across the country with the addition of Zeta, Eta, Theta, and Kappa at the College of New Jersey, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Chicago, and Northwestern University.</p>

                <h1>Establishment of Lambda Chapter at Boston University</h1>
                <p>On October 27th, 2022, the Lambda Chapter was officially founded here at Boston University. Presidents Paul Lee and Tye Robison had the idea to bring a new kind of fraternity to Boston and bring together STEM majors from all kinds of backgrounds, spiritually similar to the dream of Louise and Jing just over a decade ago. Tye and Paul ran interviews for E-Board and Lambda grew to include 8 more people: Evan Lapid, Jaden Hsiao, Camille Herzog, Rylie Love, Peachy Malik, Anissa Patel, Patrick Blejwas, and George Audi.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
                <h1>Growth into 2023 and Beyond</h1>
                <p>In the spring of 2023, Lambda held its inaugural rush and warmly embraced an Alpha class consisting of around 30 students. As we speak, KTP's presence at BU is in the midst of an exciting expansion, and our mission to unite STEM students from diverse disciplines, backgrounds, and aspirations is actively evolving. Moreover, new chapters are continually sprouting up across the nation, as if the history of our fraternity is writing itself in real-time.</p>

            <h1><span style="color:#a3e4a3;">"</span> president's welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Lambda Chapter of Kappa Theta Pi, Boston University's first co-ed professional technology based fraternity. On behalf of our E-board, I am excited to introduce you to our newly established chapter and website in which we will demonstrate the goals and aims of KTP at BU.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kappa Theta Pi is the nation's first technology based professional fraternity and with that comes a responsibility to encourage our members to expand their knowledge of technology into multiple realms of academic and intellectual advancement. With that, KTP is centered around five primary pillars: professional development, alumni connections, social growth, technological advancement, and academic support. Throughout the year, we plan on expanding our brother's passions for technology by hosting various technology workshops, social events, professional development lessons, and more in and around the newly established Computing and Data Science building.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As we begin our first ever rush semester, we hope to garner a group of individuals from all backgrounds and majors who share a communal love for tech. We thrive off of holding diverse perspectives and unique experiences which only serve to expand our collective knowledge of technology and the world around us. We strive to celebrate diversity and inclusivity by accepting students from all walks of life - meaning that we will not discriminate based upon: ethnicity, gender, sexuality, major, social class, etc because we are dedicated to uniting our brothers by our shared enthusiasm for technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The choice to organize Kappa Theta Pi at BU was made with the intention of fostering a community of individuals who are friends, inspirations to one-another, and interested in pursuing professional careers and lifelong connections. We hope to encourage our members into positions of leadership in software development, engineering, computer science, and more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From the short time we have had so far in building the foundation for KTP, we have already recognized an extreme knack for hard work and commitment from the wonderful members of the E-board who are dedicated to turning KTP at BU into an organization wholly intent on pushing our members to positions of greatness.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is our immense pleasure to be serving as your Co-Presidents of Kappa Theta Pi this year. This website will provide you with all necessary information regarding our program and how to join, but please do not hesitate to reach out to any members of the E-Board with questions you may have!</p>
            <br>

        <h1><span style="color: #a3e4a3;">"</span> DEI commitment</h1>

        <p>The world of technology is unique, diverse, and multi-faceted. We believe that our brothers should be too. In Kappa Theta Pi, we're passionate about cultivating an inclusive community that promotes and values diversity. Our dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion is unwavering; these values are central to our mission and to our impact. We know that having heterogeneous perspectives helps generate better ideas to solve the nuanced problems of a changing — and increasingly diverse — world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In KTP, we have a responsibility to address structural inequality in our communities as well as the social and cultural dimensions of technology. We are committed to harnessing the best of KTP — our people, platform, and technical innovation — to make lasting change inside and outside of our organization.</p>
